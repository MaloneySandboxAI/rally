- **Build tool**: Conductor (AI code agent) for feature builds; Cowork for planning, reviews, fixes

## Key Architecture

### Categories
Defined in `lib/categories.ts` with `isMath` flag:
- **Math** (isMath: true): Algebra, Data & Statistics, AP Pre Calculus
- **Non-math** (isMath: false): Reading Comprehension, Grammar, AP Biology, AP US History, AP English Language

### Gem Economy
- Solo timed rates: Easy 10, Medium 20, Hard 40
- Challenge rates: Easy 40, Medium 80, Hard 160 (4x multiplier)
- Speed bonus: 1.5x for fast answers (timed only — no speed bonus in untimed)
- Untimed practice: same as solo timed rates (Easy 10, Medium 20, Hard 40); daily gem cap still applies for free users

### Daily gem cap (earning-only — never blocks gameplay)
Free users earn up to 100 gems/day. This is an **EARNING** cap, not a gameplay cap — users always get to play and earn streak credit even after hitting it. The cap is enforced via `recordGemsEarned` + `Math.min(totalEarned, dailyGemsRemaining)` in the results-awarding flow in `app/play/page.tsx`; `dailyGemsCapped` no longer sets `soloBlocked` (the `soloBlocked` screen now only handles hearts/round-limit gating, where the user can refill hearts with gems). When capped, the results screen shows a positive "you've earned today's max gems" notice (via the `gemsCapped` prop on `ResultsScreen`).

On iOS native, no upsell is shown (Guideline 3.1.1) — capped users see a friendly "you've maxed out today's gems! keep playing for streak + practice" toast instead of an upgrade prompt. Web/Android keep the existing "upgrade for unlimited gems" toast. v1.1 plan: add IAP and re-introduce an iOS upgrade path.

### Hearts (lives) — solo timed only
Free players get 5 hearts/day. **-1 per wrong answer** (and per timeout) in **solo** play — challenges and untimed mode never cost hearts. Hearts are deducted **at the end of the round, one per wrong answer** (not mid-game), in the results-awarding effect in `app/play/page.tsx`. At 0 hearts (or after 3 free solo rounds/day), solo play hits the `soloBlocked` screen with a "refill 5 hearts (200 gems)" option. Pro users bypass all limits. Implementation: `lib/hearts.ts` (`getHearts`, `loseHeart`, `refillHearts`, `canPlaySolo`, `incrementRoundsToday`).

Hearts/rounds reset to full once per **calendar day** (`maybeResetForNewDay` compares a stored `rally_hearts_date` against today; date string is from `toISOString()`, i.e. UTC). This is intentional — do not remove it.

**Hearts are localStorage-only — never server-synced (the "never decrement / reset between rounds" fix, June 28 2026).** `lib/sync.ts` is **live** despite its "localStorage-only" header comment: `syncToServer()` fires on every gem change (`lib/gem-context.tsx`) and `syncFromServer()` ("server wins — overwrite local") runs in `auth-gate.tsx` **on every navigation** (effect deps `[pathname, router]`). It used to round-trip hearts/rounds through the `user_state` table. Two compounding problems made hearts appear to never decrement (#38) and reset between rounds (#42): (1) `syncToServer`'s upsert payload included `subtopic_levels` and `diagnostic` columns that **do not exist** in `user_state` (see migration 006) — so **every server write failed silently** (caught by the try/catch), leaving the server's hearts value frozen; and (2) `syncFromServer` then restored that frozen value over the local decrement on the next navigation. (An earlier attempt that merely reordered the decrement before the gem award did not help, because the write never lands.) **Fix: hearts/rounds are NOT synced — they live purely in localStorage** (`lib/hearts.ts`, daily reset). They reset daily, so cross-device sync has no real value, and round-tripping them is exactly what caused #38/#42. Everything else durable IS synced — see "State sync" below.

### State sync — last-write-wins (June 28 2026)
`lib/sync.ts` syncs **durable progress** (gems, streak, stats, subtopic levels, diagnostic, target score) to the `user_state` table so it survives reinstall and follows the user across devices. **hearts/rounds are excluded** (localStorage-only).

- **Write-through, debounced.** `syncToServer()` is debounced (~800ms) and fire-and-forget; it builds the **full** snapshot from localStorage (`buildState`) and upserts with a fresh `updated_at`. Because every push sends the whole snapshot, any field changed since the last sync (e.g. diagnostic) rides along on the next gem/round sync — no need to call it from every mutation site. Triggers: gem changes (`lib/gem-context.tsx`) and `markRoundCompleted()`.
- **Restore = last-write-wins.** `syncFromServer()` (run by `initSync()` in `auth-gate.tsx`, on every navigation) compares the server's `updated_at` with a localStorage mirror `rally_state_updated_at`. Newer wins. On adoption it writes localStorage and dispatches a `rally-state-restored` window event so `gem-context` refreshes the in-memory balance live.
- **First-contact guard (critical).** When this device has no `rally_state_updated_at` (fresh reinstall OR an existing user upgrading to this build), it does **NOT** blindly take the server. It uses `serverIsRicher()` — adopt the server only if it clearly has more progress (more gems, or play history this device lacks). This is what prevents a default/empty server row (`gems=300`) from wiping real local data — the bug that previously reset everyone to 300. **Never replace this with a plain "server wins on load."**
- **Requires migration `026_user_state_sync_columns.sql`** (adds `subtopic_levels` + `diagnostic` columns — their absence is what made every write fail silently before). Until it's applied the upsert fails, `rally_state_updated_at` is never set, and local simply keeps winning (no data loss, no persistence). The write only stamps `rally_state_updated_at` when the upsert actually succeeds.

Pro/premium note: `loseHeart()` no-ops for pro users (`isPro()` reads `rally_is_pro`, synced from server subscription truth in `lib/premium-context.tsx`) and premium has no gem cap — so on a **premium test account, hearts not decrementing is correct behavior**, not a bug.

### Challenge System
- **Flow**: Creator picks category -> shares link -> THEN plays their round (link must be shared before play unlocks)
- **Scoring**: Winner determined by total gems earned (not correct count) — rewards harder difficulty
- **Shared question pool**: 15 questions per challenge (5 easy + 5 medium + 5 hard), stored as flat `integer[]` in DB
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Both players start easy, bump up on correct, drop on wrong, drawing from the same pool
- **DB sentinel**: `creator_score = -1` means creator hasn't played yet; `status` is 'pending' or 'completed'
- **H2H records**: `head_to_head` table tracks win/loss/draw between player pairs, deduplicated by sorted user IDs
- **Share cards**: Screenshot-friendly result cards with gradient backgrounds, rendered via canvas

### Group/Classroom Challenges
- Teacher or student creates a group challenge with a shareable code
- Multiple participants join and compete on the same question pool
- Leaderboard shows all participants ranked by gems earned
- Route: `app/group/[code]/page.tsx`
- Logic: `lib/group-challenges.ts`

### Question Pool Storage
- `question_ids` column is `integer[]` (NOT jsonb)
- `poolToFlat(pool)`: flattens `{easy, medium, hard}` to `[...easy, ...medium, ...hard]`
- `poolFromFlat(flat)`: reconstructs by slicing at indices 0-5, 5-10, 10-15

### Question history — per-user, persistent
Logged-in users have their seen questions tracked in `user_question_history` (Supabase). The picker (`getOneQuestion` in `lib/questions.ts`) excludes any IDs that appear in this table for the current user + category. When a user has seen every question in a category, both the in-memory `sessionUsedIds` and the DB history are reset and a toast tells them they're starting fresh. Guest (unauthenticated) users keep the session-only behavior they had before. Challenge mode is unaffected — challenges share a pre-built question pool by design.

### Timer System (category-aware)
- Math categories: Easy 45s, Medium 75s, Hard 120s
- Reading categories: Easy 35s, Medium 55s, Hard 90s
- Untimed practice mode: no timer, endless 1-at-a-time questions

### Untimed Practice Mode
- Toggle on skills page subtopic tap
- URL param: `&untimed=true` on `/play`
- No timer, no hearts/lives, no speed bonus; earns gems at solo rate (same as timed)
- Endless play — user taps "done" in header when finished
- Full explanation shown after each answer (not line-clamped)
- Stats, streaks, and gems all adjust on round completion; daily gem cap applies for free users
- **Does NOT count toward subtopic leveling** (see "Adaptive difficulty"). Instead, when an untimed run would have earned a promotion, a mid-round toast nudges the user to timed mode ("play timed mode to level up!"). Uses a session-local shadow window; never persists.
- Gem-earned summary card shown on results screen with breakdown by difficulty

### Adaptive difficulty (per-subtopic levels)
Each subtopic (not category) has an independent level **1–5** for the signed-in user, labeled "Level 1"–"Level 5" (`LEVEL_LABELS`) and mapping to question difficulty via `levelToDifficulty`: **L1** easy · **L2** 60% medium / 40% easy · **L3** medium · **L4** 60% hard / 40% medium · **L5** hard. There are only 3 underlying question difficulties (easy/medium/hard) in the bank; the 5 tiers are gradations built on top, with L2/L4 as blends. L2 leans *medium* (not easy) so leveling up feels decisive — an earlier easy-lean at L2 made level-ups feel like nothing changed. The diagnostic seeds starting levels; live play adjusts them. State lives in `lib/subtopic-levels.ts`, localStorage key `rally_subtopic_levels`, and is server-synced via `user_state.subtopic_levels` (rides along in the sync snapshot — see "State sync").

**Adjusted PER ATTEMPT** (not per round) via `recordAttempt(subtopicId, isCorrect)`, called once per graded question from `applyAdaptiveAttempt` in `app/play/page.tsx`. Rolling window + streak are tracked **per subtopic × current level** (`recentAttempts: boolean[]` ≤6, `streak: number` where + = correct run, − = wrong run).

- **Promote** (level +1): 4 correct in a row (fast-track), OR ≥75% across a full 6-attempt window.
- **Demote** (level −1): 4 wrong in a row (safety net), OR <40% across a full window. **Suppressed until >20 lifetime attempts** in the subtopic (new-user floor). Promotions are never floored.
- **Reset on change**: `recentAttempts` + `streak` clear to empty on any level change; lifetime totals persist.
- **UI**: promotions fire a `toast.success("💪 leveled up to <label>!")`; **demotions are silent** (no message — users shouldn't feel called out).

**Which modes count:**
- **Solo timed (with subtopic)**: counts; the level drives the next question's difficulty. This replaced the old aggressive within-round bump (one correct answer instantly jumped easy→medium) — the confirmed bug.
- **Challenges**: **count** — each answered pool question feeds `recordAttempt(question.subtopic, …)`, so competing is a real way to level up (a key differentiator). The competitive shared-pool difficulty bump (both players escalate identically) is unchanged; leveling rides on top of it.
- **Untimed practice**: does NOT count (see above — shadow nudge only).
- **Solo timed without a subtopic** (e.g. "practice weakest category" links): no persistent level exists, so it keeps the legacy within-round easy↔medium↔hard bump; nothing persisted.

Tuning constants (`WINDOW_SIZE`, `PROMOTE_RATIO`, `DEMOTE_RATIO`, `STREAK_PROMOTE`, `STREAK_DEMOTE`, `DEMOTE_FLOOR`) are all in `lib/subtopic-levels.ts` — easy to nudge.

### Question transition + the phantom-timeout bug
Advancing to the next question (timeout auto-advance AND the "next" button) goes through `advanceToNextQuestion()` in `app/play/page.tsx`. Two things matter here:

1. **Phantom timeout (the real "double-advance" bug).** The time-up effect fires on `timeRemaining === 0 && selectedAnswer === null`. After a timeout auto-advance, the *new* question's `timeRemaining` is momentarily still `0` (stale from the question that just timed out) and `selectedAnswer` has been reset to `null`. Because the time-up effect is defined **before** the reset-timer effect, it ran first and fired a **phantom timeout** on the fresh question — instantly auto-failing and skipping it (console showed two back-to-back "Next question" logs with no input). Fix: the time-up effect is gated on **`isTimerActive`**, and `advanceToNextQuestion` sets `setIsTimerActive(false)` as part of the swap. The reset-timer effect (fires on `currentQuestion` change) re-activates the timer with a full `timeRemaining`, so the new question starts clean. **Don't remove the `isTimerActive` guard or the `setIsTimerActive(false)` in the advance.**

2. **Transition masking.** `advanceToNextQuestion` holds the `isLoadingNext` spinner up across the **entire** swap — `fetchNextQuestion()` only *appends* to `sessionQuestions`; the `currentQuestion` increment + answer reset + `isTimerActive=false` + spinner clear all land in one batched commit. Don't move `isLoadingNext` management back into `fetchNextQuestion`.

### Gem display notes
- The per-correct-answer floating popup (`FloatingGemIndicator`) shows that **single question's** value (challenge hard = 160, etc.) — accurate, not a bug. It can exceed the round summary because the **daily gem cap** trims the actual award (`Math.min(totalEarned, dailyGemsRemaining)`) below the sum of per-question values. Expected behavior.
- The big end-of-round "N total gems!" overlay is `GemMilestoneCelebration` (`components/rally/gem-milestone.tsx`), which fires when crossing a **lifetime** total (100/500/1000…), not round earnings. Copy says "total gems" / "you've reached" precisely so it isn't misread as this round's haul.
- The full-screen **`SpeedBonusAnimation`** (`components/rally/countdown-timer.tsx`), shown on a fast correct answer (timed only), used to display a **hardcoded `+150 gems`** — wrong in solo (real speed values are 15/30/60 easy/medium/hard). Fixed June 28 2026: it now takes an `amount` prop and the play page passes the real `speedGemPerCorrect`. **Don't reintroduce a literal number here.**

### Calculator Integration
- Component: `components/rally/free-calculator.tsx` (MathLive + math.js + function-plot — MIT/Apache 2.0)
- WorkArea (`components/rally/work-area.tsx`) conditionally renders FreeCalculator for math categories, basic calculator for non-math
- `isMath` prop passed from play page based on category config
- Libraries loaded dynamically (only when Calculator tab opens) — ~1.5MB, doesn't touch main bundle
- Inline scalar evaluation: type `3+4*2` → shows `= 11`; type expressions with `x` to plot them

### Push Notifications
- Service worker registration in app
- `lib/push-notifications.ts` handles subscription and delivery
- `lib/challenge-notify.ts` sends notifications when opponent completes a challenge
- Supabase stores push subscriptions

### Referral System
- Referral codes linked to users
- Bonus gems for successful referrals via challenge links
- RLS policies on referral tables

### Weekly Recap
- `lib/weekly-recap.ts` computes weekly stats (who you played, record, best win)
- `components/rally/weekly-recap-card.tsx` renders the recap

### Friends / Recent Opponents
- `components/rally/recent-opponents.tsx` shows recent opponents with quick-challenge shortcut

### Stale Challenge Cleanup
- Pending challenges older than 7 days show as "expired" in games list
- Creator can delete individually (X button) or batch delete all expired

### Analytics
- PostHog for analytics, person profiles via `posthog.identify()` in `lib/posthog-provider.tsx`
- Internal user filtering: cohort excludes @evaine.ai and ctgmaloney@gmail.com

### Premium / Subscriptions
- Stripe integration for upgrades
- `lib/subscription.ts` and `lib/premium-context.tsx` manage premium state
- `app/upgrade/page.tsx` and `app/upgrade/success/page.tsx` for upgrade flow

### iOS native platform — upgrade UI hidden
The iOS app (Capacitor WebView, loads the live site via `capacitor.config.ts`) hides all entry points to `/upgrade` to comply with Apple Guideline 3.1.1 (digital subscriptions require Apple IAP, not Stripe). Detection uses `useIsNativeIOS()` in `lib/use-platform.ts`, which reads `window.Capacitor` directly (no `@capacitor/core` dependency, SSR-safe, defaults to `false`). Web and Android keep the existing Stripe flow unchanged.

Entry points gated on iOS native:
- `app/play/page.tsx` — gem-cap toasts (timed + untimed) drop the "unlock" action and just say "come back tomorrow"; the `soloBlocked` gem-cap screen drops the "unlock unlimited gems" button (hearts refill, which costs gems not money, still works).
- `components/rally/header.tsx` — daily gem-cap indicator renders as a plain `<span>` instead of a `/upgrade` link.
- `app/account/page.tsx` — free users see neither the "Upgrade to Premium" card nor the locked "Parent Progress Report" upsell; premium users keep "Manage Subscription" (account management, not a purchase).
- `components/rally/challenge-button.tsx` — hitting the free-challenge limit shows an informational toast instead of redirecting to `/upgrade`; button label/subtext avoid "upgrade"/"premium" wording.
- `app/upgrade/page.tsx` — if reached via a deep link on iOS, redirects to `/home` (and renders a spinner, never flashing the Stripe UI).

Note: `components/rally/pro-banner.tsx` shows pricing but is dead code (imported nowhere), so it never surfaces on iOS. The `usePremium` gating itself is unchanged — only the upsell prompts are hidden.

v1.1 plan: replace the hidden UI with native StoreKit IAP via a Capacitor plugin so iOS users can subscribe in-app, then restore the upgrade UI routed through IAP instead of Stripe.

### Session storage — cookie-based (not localStorage)
The Supabase browser client stores the session in a first-party cookie (`sb-*`), not localStorage. This survives Safari ITP's 7-day idle purge, which was causing students to re-log in every time they clicked a new challenge link from iMessage. Cookie config: `Max-Age=30 days`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure`.

The companion fix (iOS Universal Links so iMessage opens the Rally app directly instead of Safari) is implemented — see "iOS Universal Links" below.

### Sign in with Apple
Rally supports Sign in with Apple via `lib/auth-apple.ts` (`signInWithApple(redirectTo?)`), wired into the "Continue with Apple" button at the top of `app/login/page.tsx` (above Google — Apple's iOS convention). On iOS native (Capacitor) it invokes the native Face ID / Touch ID sheet, then hands the returned identity token to Supabase via `signInWithIdToken({ provider: "apple" })` — no browser redirect. On web and Android it falls back to Supabase's standard `signInWithOAuth({ provider: "apple" })` redirect flow.

Like the rest of the codebase, the helper reaches the native plugin through the global `window.Capacitor.Plugins.SignInWithApple` bridge rather than importing `@capacitor-community/apple-sign-in` / `@capacitor/core` (matches `lib/use-platform.ts` and `lib/capacitor-deep-links.ts`) — so the web bundle has no hard Capacitor dependency and the web build needs no npm install. The native iOS project still needs the plugin: `pnpm add @capacitor-community/apple-sign-in` then `npx cap sync ios` (on the user's Mac), which registers the bridge.

Configured providers in Supabase (Authentication → Providers → Apple):
- Client IDs: `com.rallyplaylive.web,com.rallyplaylive.app` (Services ID for web, Bundle ID for native)
- Secret Key: 180-day JWT signed with the .p8 key (Key ID `866P6U22N8`, Team ID `U9VU383K79`) from the Apple Developer Portal — regenerate every ~180 days (calendar reminder for end of November 2026) with `~/Documents/Rally/generate-apple-jwt.mjs` and paste into Supabase before web sign-in breaks.

Apple Guideline 4.8: required because Rally offers Google OAuth.

### Account deletion (Guideline 5.1.1(v))
`POST /api/account/delete` (`app/api/account/delete/route.ts`) hard-deletes the caller's account. It identifies the user from their session cookie (`createRouteHandlerClient().auth.getUser()` — never trusts a client-supplied id), then uses the service-role client (`createServiceRoleClient()`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) to **explicitly clean up every table that references the user before** calling `auth.admin.deleteUser(uid)`:
- **Challenges**: rows where the user is the **creator** are **deleted** (not nulled) — the `challenges_protect_fields` BEFORE UPDATE trigger from migration 022 blocks any non-creator from changing `creator_*` columns, and the service role has no `auth.uid()`, so an UPDATE would raise `P0001: Only the challenge creator can modify creator fields`; DELETE isn't trigger-guarded and also clears the creator's name/scores. Rows where the user is only the **challenger** are anonymized (`challenger_id`/`challenger_name` → null — those aren't creator fields, so the trigger allows it), preserving the creator's game.
- **Anonymized (row kept)** so shared games survive: `group_challenges` and `group_challenge_entries` (name columns are NOT NULL, so the user's name → `"Deleted user"` and the id → null), `feedback.user_id` → null, and `users.referred_by` → null (on anyone this user referred).
- **Deleted (the user's own data)**: `head_to_head` (either player — the table is `head_to_head`, confirmed via live FK audit + `lib/head-to-head.ts` + migration 019; an earlier draft mistakenly used `head_to_head_records`), `referrals` (referrer or referred — NOT NULL FKs, can't null), `push_subscriptions`, `user_state`, `parent_tokens` (ignored if the table doesn't exist in prod), `user_seen_questions` (keyed on `player_id` **text**, no FK). `user_question_history` (uuid FK, CASCADE) and `public.users` (CASCADE) are cleaned up by `deleteUser()` automatically; `public.users` is also deleted explicitly first so its NO ACTION dependents (`referrals`) are already cleared.

Why explicit cleanup instead of relying on FK cascades: several of those FKs use the default **NO ACTION** rule and `public.users` isn't created by any migration (so its delete rule is unknown and prod can drift) — `deleteUser()` alone would throw an FK violation. Explicit cleanup makes the endpoint correct regardless of live FK rules, so **no migration has to be applied for it to work**. Per-table cleanup errors are logged but non-fatal; `deleteUser()` is the decisive gate (500 on failure). Stripe is intentionally untouched (Stripe owns that data lifecycle).

Client side (`app/account/page.tsx`, `handleDeleteAccount`): for logged-in users it `POST`s the endpoint and aborts on failure (showing `deleteError` inline) so the user is never left signed-out with data still on the server; on success (and for guests, who have no server account) it removes **all** `rally_*` localStorage keys, signs out, and redirects to `/login`.

Audit note: if a table created directly in the Supabase dashboard (not in `supabase/migrations/`) also FKs to `auth.users` with NO ACTION and holds rows for the user, `deleteUser()` will 500 — run the FK-rule audit query (see the account-deletion task notes) against live Supabase; if it surfaces an unlisted table, add one `step(...)` line to the route.

### iOS Universal Links — open challenge links in the app
So iMessage challenge links open the native Rally app (where the student is already authenticated) instead of a fresh Safari context, the app serves an Apple App Site Association (AASA) file and the native shell routes incoming links to the matching in-app page.

- **AASA route**: `app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association/route.ts` serves the AASA JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`. It reads `process.env.APPLE_TEAM_ID` at request time (`dynamic = "force-dynamic"`) and pairs it with the bundle ID `com.rallyplaylive.app`. Linked paths: `/challenge/*`, `/group/*`, `/c/*`, `/g/*`, `/join`, `/home`.
- **Deep-link handler**: `lib/capacitor-deep-links.ts` (`initDeepLinks()`) listens for Capacitor's `appUrlOpen` event and `window.location.replace()`s to `pathname + search` for `*.rallyplaylive.com` URLs so the auth gate runs on the destination. It reaches the App plugin via the global `window.Capacitor.Plugins.App` bridge rather than importing `@capacitor/app`/`@capacitor/core` — same no-hard-dependency, SSR-safe pattern as `lib/use-platform.ts`, so nothing is added to the web bundle and no npm install is needed for the web build. `components/rally/deep-link-init.tsx` (`<DeepLinkInit />`, mounted in `app/layout.tsx`) calls it once on mount; it's a no-op outside the native iOS shell.

**Manual steps required (one-time, outside this repo):**
1. **Apple Team ID** — from developer.apple.com → Membership Details (10-char alphanumeric). _(Already set in Vercel for this project per the build instructions.)_
2. **Vercel env** — add `APPLE_TEAM_ID=XXXXXXXXXX` for Production + Preview, then redeploy so the AASA route serves the real value (not `REPLACE_WITH_TEAM_ID`).
3. **Native iOS project** — install the App plugin so `appUrlOpen` fires: `pnpm add @capacitor/app` then `npx cap sync ios` (run on the user's Mac; the sandbox can't reach npm).
4. **Xcode** — `npx cap open ios`, select the Rally target → Signing & Capabilities → "+ Capability" → **Associated Domains**, add `applinks:www.rallyplaylive.com` and `applinks:rallyplaylive.com`. Confirm the Team is selected under Signing.
5. **Verify** — visit `https://www.rallyplaylive.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` (should return JSON with the real team + bundle ID), validate at `https://search.developer.apple.com/appsearch-validation-tool/`, then test on a **physical device** (Universal Links don't work in the simulator from iMessage): send a challenge link via iMessage from another phone, tap it → opens the Rally app at `/challenge/CODE`, already logged in.

### Reviewer bypass (App Store submission only)
`app/auth/reviewer/route.ts` accepts `?token=XXX` and signs the browser in as `reviewer@rallyplaylive.com` if the token matches `REVIEWER_BYPASS_TOKEN`. Used solely for Apple's App Store reviewer who cannot receive magic link emails. The route returns 404 if the env var is missing, so removing the env var from Vercel disables the bypass cleanly without a code change. Remove after v1 is approved.

## Design Conventions
- **Mobile-first**: All layouts optimized for iPhone, minimize scrolling
- **Dark theme**: Navy background (#021f3d), blue accents (#378ADD), light blue text (#85B7EB)
- **Category colors**: Algebra #378ADD, Reading #14B8A6, Grammar #A855F7, Data #F97316, AP Bio #22C55E, AP Pre Calc #EC4899, APUSH #F59E0B, AP English #6366F1
- **Font weights**: Use font-extrabold for headings, font-bold for labels
- **Rounded corners**: rounded-xl for cards, rounded-2xl for larger containers
- **Bottom sheets**: Used for mode selection, work area, challenges
- **WorkArea z-index**: z-50 for the bottom sheet overlay

## Development Workflow
- Sandbox cannot reach npm registry or Supabase directly — can only edit files
- User pushes from local terminal: `cd ~/Desktop/rally && git add -A && git commit -m "msg" && git push origin main`
- Vercel auto-deploys on push to main (typically ~30-35s build time)
- `next.config.mjs` has `ignoreBuildErrors: true` — type errors don't block deploys
- Feature builds done via Conductor (AI agent) using detailed prompts
- Code reviews and fixes done in Cowork sessions
- User prefers "auto mode" with minimal back-and-forth
- **IMPORTANT**: At the end of every session, proactively offer to run the `session-wrapup` skill to update CLAUDE.md and PROJECT-STATUS.md with what was accomplished. Also run it after any Conductor build is pushed. This keeps the docs accurate across sessions and devices.

- [x] Replaced Desmos with open-source calculator stack (MathLive + math.js + function-plot) — eliminates $100/mo recurring cost
### Database Migrations
- No Supabase CLI is configured. Migrations under `supabase/migrations/` are applied **manually** by pasting the SQL into the Supabase dashboard SQL Editor. The folder is a git-tracked history of what's been run, not an automated pipeline.
- Apply migrations in filename order. After running a migration in the dashboard, the corresponding `.sql` file is what records "this ran" — don't skip committing it.
- **Production DB can drift from the file history.** Some migrations on disk are already applied in prod (e.g. policies created by an earlier commit), and some features in the file history were never deployed against prod (e.g. `parent_tokens` from 008). Before running anything, check whether the target objects already exist.
- **All new migrations must be idempotent.** Use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, and the `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` → `CREATE POLICY` pattern (Postgres has no `CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS`). Wrap conditional logic in `DO $$ ... $$` blocks. This makes re-runs safe when prod is already partially in sync.

## Question Distractor Improvement Pipeline (agent-driven, no API cost)

Rewrites wrong-answer choices to match real SAT distractor logic. Full spec: `/Users/colleenmaloney/Documents/Rally/answer-improvement-prompt.md`.

### One-time setup
1. Run `supabase/migrations/025_question_improvement_v2.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.
2. `pnpm install` (adds `tsx` and `dotenv` dev deps).
3. Confirm `.env.local` has `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

### Process
1. In Conductor, start an agent in the `rally` repo.
2. Agent loops: `pnpm tsx scripts/q-fetch.ts --batch 50 --category Algebra` → reason → write to `scripts/.batch-pending.json` → `pnpm tsx scripts/q-write.ts scripts/.batch-pending.json`.
3. Spot-check `improvement_v2` in Supabase as it processes.
4. `pnpm tsx scripts/q-promote.ts --category Algebra --dry-run` then drop `--dry-run` to promote.
5. Repeat for Data & Stats and AP Pre Calc.

### Cost
Zero metered cost. Agent reasoning uses Claude Pro/Max subscription.

### Scripts
- `scripts/q-fetch.ts` — pulls next batch of unprocessed math questions (writes JSON to stdout)
- `scripts/q-write.ts <file>` — writes improvements from a JSON file into `improvement_v2` column
- `scripts/q-promote.ts [--category X] [--dry-run]` — promotes staged improvements → live columns

## Pending / Roadmap
- [ ] Desmos API: obtain production API key (partnership email sent May 26, 2026 — awaiting reply; currently using demo key)
- [ ] Decide on parent dashboard: either run migration 008 to create `parent_tokens` table (the `/parent/[token]` route is shipped in code but non-functional in prod), or remove the route from the app
- [ ] iOS App Store launch — execute `APP-STORE-LAUNCH-PLAN.md` (Capacitor wrap of the live Next.js site → TestFlight → submit). Done in Cowork. Guideline 3.1.1 (Stripe vs Apple IAP) handled for v1 by hiding upgrade UI on iOS (see "iOS native platform — upgrade UI hidden"). Remaining risks: Google OAuth in webview, Sign in with Apple.
- [x] iOS Universal Links — web side implemented (AASA route + Capacitor deep-link handler); see "iOS Universal Links" section. Remaining: manual native steps (set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` is done in Vercel; `pnpm add @capacitor/app` + `npx cap sync ios`; Xcode Associated Domains; physical-device test)

## App Store Launch (June 26, 2026)
- **Approach:** wrap the existing Next.js app in a **Capacitor** native iOS shell loading the live site (`https://rallyplaylive.com`). **No Flutter rebuild.** FoxDog was used **only** for the legal/account foundation and is scoped out of the build (its Flutter scaffold/ship pipeline doesn't apply to Next.js).
- **Legal/account foundation (complete via FoxDog):** LLC formed, registered agent, EIN, DUNS, Apple Developer enrollment, store account.
- **Full plan + Cowork handoff:** see `APP-STORE-LAUNCH-PLAN.md` at repo root.

## Recently Completed (June 30, 2026)
- [x] **Adaptive difficulty rework — threshold + fast-track + safety net per subtopic** (PR [#24](https://github.com/MaloneySandboxAI/rally/pull/24), commit `f2eded8`, **merged + live on prod**). Replaced the aggressive per-question difficulty bump — a single correct answer instantly jumped easy→medium (the confirmed bug, "33% accuracy on easy still promoted") — with a rolling-window threshold system on the existing per-subtopic 1–5 levels. `recordAttempt()` (per graded question) promotes on 4-correct-in-a-row OR ≥75%/6, demotes on 4-wrong OR <40%/6 (floored to >20 lifetime attempts), resetting window+streak on any change; one `applyAdaptiveAttempt` helper in `app/play/page.tsx` owns difficulty + leveling and replaced both end-of-round `adjustSubtopicLevel` calls. **Challenges now count** toward leveling (each pool question feeds `recordAttempt(question.subtopic, …)`) while keeping the competitive shared-pool bump — a key differentiator; **untimed doesn't count** but fires a "play timed to level up" nudge via a shadow window; solo-timed-without-subtopic keeps the legacy within-round bump. Promotions toast, demotions silent. Full detail in "### Adaptive difficulty (per-subtopic levels)". **Verified:** `tsc` clean for the two changed files, dev server compiles/serves `/`, `/skills`, both `/play` variants at 200. **Not verified interactively** — this workspace's `.env.local` has a placeholder Supabase anon key (401 on all queries), so promote/demote/nudge behavior still needs a browser walkthrough with a real key.
- [x] **Level labels + mapping retune** (follow-up to #24, branch `MaloneySandboxAI/tier-promotion-rules`) — renamed the 5 tiers to plain **Level 1–Level 5** (`LEVEL_LABELS`; surfaces in the level-up toast, `/skills`, category rings, `/ap`, parent dashboard — dropped the redundant `lv N ·` prefixes). Retuned `levelToDifficulty` so **Level 2 = 60% medium / 40% easy** (was easy-lean), so leveling up feels decisive and stops handing back easy questions right after a promotion. Underlying bank is still only 3 difficulties (easy/medium/hard); the 5 tiers are gradations with L2/L4 as blends. See "### Adaptive difficulty (per-subtopic levels)".
- [x] **Sandbox env gotcha documented** — the Conductor workspace's `.env.local` is a scrubbed template (anon key = literal `eyJ...`, Stripe/PostHog/etc. all stubs); the npm/Supabase "can't reach" limitation is a per-command network sandbox, not the machine. Fix: run network commands (`pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`) with the sandbox disabled; drop the real Supabase `anon` key (from the dashboard → Settings → API, project `rmbzpxvsejbugsgflqsv`, or Vercel) into `.env.local` to load data locally. This is workspace config only — production/Vercel is unaffected.

## Recently Completed (June 29, 2026)
- [x] **Hearts never decremented / reset between rounds (#38, #42)** — root cause was the live state-sync layer, not the hearts module. `syncToServer`'s upsert wrote `subtopic_levels`/`diagnostic` columns that don't exist in `user_state` (migration 006), so every write failed silently and `syncFromServer` ("server wins", runs every navigation) restored the frozen value over the local decrement. Fixed by removing hearts/rounds from sync entirely — they're now localStorage-only (PRs #18 reorder attempt, then #19). See "Hearts (lives)".
- [x] **Speed-bonus popup showed a hardcoded `+150 gems`** — `SpeedBonusAnimation` (`components/rally/countdown-timer.tsx`) had a literal; real solo speed values are 15/30/60. Now takes an `amount` prop fed `speedGemPerCorrect` (PR #19). See "Gem display notes".
- [x] **Gems reset to 300 on navigation** — same broken sync (frozen-default server row clobbering local). First disabled the whole round-trip (PR #20), then…
- [x] **Real cross-device state sync** (PR #22, commit `97135f9`, live on prod) — `lib/sync.ts` rewritten to last-write-wins: debounced full-snapshot write-through + `updated_at`-timestamped restore, with a **first-contact "richer side wins" guard** so a default/empty server row can never wipe real local data. Requires migration `026_user_state_sync_columns.sql` (**applied in prod by user June 29**). Hearts/rounds stay localStorage-only. See "State sync — last-write-wins".

## Recently Completed (June 28, 2026)
- [x] Fixed **phantom timeout auto-skipping the next question** (commit `25bf1fa`, live on prod) — after a question timed out, the next one instantly auto-failed and skipped ahead. The time-up effect was re-firing on the fresh question's stale `timeRemaining===0` before the reset-timer effect re-initialized the clock. Gated the time-up effect on `isTimerActive` and set `isTimerActive=false` during the swap. See "Question transition + the phantom-timeout bug".
- [x] Hardened the timeout→next-question transition (commit `2c3937a`, live on prod) — `advanceToNextQuestion()` holds the spinner across the whole swap as one batched commit; `fetchNextQuestion()` is now append-only.
- [x] Gem milestone overlay copy (commit `2c3937a`, live on prod) — "N total gems!"/"you've reached…" instead of "gems earned!" so the lifetime-milestone celebration isn't misread as round earnings. See "Gem display notes".

## Recently Completed (June 26, 2026)
- [x] iOS Universal Links (web side) — AASA file served at `app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association/route.ts` (keyed off `APPLE_TEAM_ID` + bundle `com.rallyplaylive.app`), Capacitor `appUrlOpen` deep-link handler in `lib/capacitor-deep-links.ts` via the `window.Capacitor` bridge (no `@capacitor/app` web import — matches `lib/use-platform.ts` pattern), wired into `app/layout.tsx` through `components/rally/deep-link-init.tsx`. Branch `MaloneySandboxAI/universal-links`, not yet pushed/merged. Part 2 (cookie session) was already live on main. Remaining = native-project manual steps (see "iOS Universal Links").
- [x] Apple Guideline 3.1.1 compliance — hide all Stripe upgrade UI on iOS native via `useIsNativeIOS()` (`lib/use-platform.ts`); see "iOS native platform — upgrade UI hidden" for the full list of gated entry points (PR #7, live on prod). Verified hiding logic in-browser with a simulated `window.Capacitor`, then removed the temporary `?fakeios` QA toggle (PR #8). Web/Android unchanged. Still TODO: final check on a real device via TestFlight.

## Recently Completed (May 29, 2026)
- [x] Reconciled DB ↔ migration-file drift — verified migrations 022, 023 applied; 024 unnecessary (waitlist already locked, `parent_tokens` doesn't exist)
- [x] Pushed 3 backlogged commits to `origin/main` (H3/M4/M10 polish, waitlist+parent_tokens RLS, merge) — Vercel auto-deployed
- [x] Removed duplicate `024_*.sql` file from repo root (was identical to the one in `supabase/migrations/`)
- [x] Documented manual migration workflow + idempotency requirement in CLAUDE.md (this section's parent doc)

## Recently Completed (May 26, 2026)
- [x] Landing page pushed to production (live at rallyplaylive.com with full OG/Twitter meta)
- [x] Untimed gem economy unified — gem-earned card now shown on results screen for untimed sessions (commit c3dc1b4)
- [x] v0 Premium subscription canceled

## FoxDog — get this app live on the App Store & Google Play

FoxDog is connected to you via the `foxdog` MCP server. The user built this app and wants your
help getting it live in the stores. They are likely **non-technical and new to the app-store
process** — explain things simply, be reassuring, and check with them before each step.

Start by calling the **`foxdog_start`** MCP tool, then do exactly what it returns, one step at a
time (advance with `foxdog_next`). FoxDog gives you the precise next action, the command to run,
and how to confirm it worked. Use `foxdog_doctor` to verify the local setup. Never ask the user
to send FoxDog any signing keys or store credentials — those stay on their machine.
